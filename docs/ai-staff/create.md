# Creating a New AI Staff Member

Creating a new AI Staff Member in Holostaff AI is a straightforward process that lays the foundation for your virtual employee. This initial step involves defining the basic identity and role of your AI.

Upon successful creation, your new AI staff member will be added to your list of AI assets, ready for further configuration and deployment.

## Steps to Create a New AI Staff Member

1.  **Access the "My Staff" Section:**
    *   From your Holostaff AI Dashboard, navigate to the "My Staff" section using the main navigation menu.
    *   This page displays a list of all your existing AI staff members.

2.  **Initiate Creation:**
    *   On the "My Staff" page, locate and click the **"Create New AI Staff"** button. This button is typically prominent (e.g., a primary colored button with a "plus" icon).

3.  **Provide Basic Information:**
    A dialog box or form will appear, prompting you to enter the core details for your new AI staff member:

    *   **AI Staff Name:** Enter a unique and recognizable name for your AI staff. This is the name your users will see when interacting with the AI. Examples: "Sarah," "Holostaff Support Bot," "Product Assistant."
    *   **Primary Role:** Select a primary role from the dropdown menu that best describes the main function this AI will perform. This helps categorize your AI and informs its default behaviors. Options include:
        *   Sales Assistant
        *   Customer Support
        *   Technical Guide
        *   Info Specialist
        *   Process Helper
        *   (*Other roles may be available depending on your plan or custom configurations.*)
    *   **Brief Description (Optional but Recommended):** Provide a concise description of what this AI staff member does. This short text helps you and your team quickly understand the AI's purpose. It might also be displayed to users in some widget configurations. Example: "Friendly, knowledgeable expert for fashion collections & general inquiries."

4.  **Confirm Creation:**
    *   Review the information you've entered.
    *   Click the **"Continue"** or **"Create AI Staff"** button.

## What Happens Next?

Once successfully created:

*   Your new AI staff member will appear in your "My Staff" list.
*   The system will automatically assign a unique ID to this AI staff member.
*   You will be redirected to the detailed configuration page for this new AI, starting with the **"Style"** tab. This is where you can further customize its appearance, personality, instructions, and deployment settings.
*   The AI will initially have a "pending" or "inactive" status, as it still needs to be configured and deployed before it can interact with users.

The process of creating an AI staff member is designed to be quick and easy, allowing you to move swiftly into customizing its intelligence and integrating it into your operations.
