# Instructions & Knowledge Configuration

The "Instructions" tab is where you define what your AI Staff Member knows and how it should use that knowledge during interactions. This involves linking your AI to relevant Knowledge Sources and providing specific directives for its behavior. A well-configured instruction set is crucial for accurate, helpful, and on-brand AI responses.

Access this tab by navigating to a specific AI Staff Member's detail page and selecting the "Instructions" tab.

## 1. Role Configuration

This section allows you to reinforce and refine the primary function of your AI Staff Member.
While you set a primary role during creation, the full power of your AI's capabilities is unlocked here by linking it to Knowledge Sources.

## 2. Knowledge Sources

This is the central part of your AI's intelligence. Here, you connect your AI staff member to the information it needs to learn from and respond based on.

*   **Select Knowledge Source:**
    *   Use the dropdown menu to choose an existing Knowledge Source. This list will display all the websites, documents, or other data you have previously processed using the Knowledge Sources feature.
    *   Upon selection, your AI staff member gains access to all the information extracted from that source.
    *   **Important:** If you haven't created any Knowledge Sources yet, please navigate to the "Knowledge" section of the platform to add your website or other data. Your AI cannot provide information without a linked Knowledge Source.

## 3. Instruction Topics

This section leverages the specific types of information extracted from your linked Knowledge Source to guide your AI's responses. By enabling or disabling these topics, you can control the kind of details your AI will emphasize.

*   When a Knowledge Source is selected, a list of "Instruction Topics" will appear. These topics correspond to the categories of information identified during the knowledge extraction process (e.g., Company Information, Products & Pricing, FAQs).
*   **Enable/Disable Topics:**
    *   Each topic can be toggled via a checkbox.
    *   **Enabled:** Your AI will prioritize and actively use information from this topic when responding to relevant queries.
    *   **Disabled:** Your AI will largely ignore information from this topic, even if it's present in the linked Knowledge Source. This is useful for focusing your AI on specific functions and avoiding irrelevant details.
*   **Review Extracted Items:** You can often expand each topic to view the specific items (e.g., individual products, specific FAQ questions and answers) that were extracted under that category. This helps you verify the quality and relevance of the data your AI will learn from. If you need to add or edit specific items, you might need to go to the "Knowledge" section for that source.

## 4. Custom Instructions

This is where you provide overarching directives and behavioral guidelines for your AI Staff Member. These instructions are like a prompt that sits 'on top' of its learned knowledge and personality.

*   **Custom Instructions Text Area:** Use this text area to input specific rules, tones, or priorities that your AI should adhere to. Examples include:
    *   "Always be polite and proactive."
    *   "If a user asks about pricing, always offer a link to the pricing page before stating numbers."
    *   "Never share personal opinions or subjective recommendations."
    *   "Always redirect technical questions beyond basic troubleshooting to human support."
    *   "If the user expresses frustration, offer to schedule a call with a human representative."

Custom instructions are powerful. They can shape your AI's responses, ensuring it stays within brand guidelines, follows specific sales processes, or manages complex situations appropriately. Be clear and concise in your instructions.

## Saving Changes

Any changes made within the "Instructions" tab are automatically saved soon after you make them. There is no explicit "Save" button to click within this tab. However, note that these changes directly impact your AI's intelligence and behavior, so regular testing is recommended after significant adjustments.
