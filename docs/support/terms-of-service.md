**Last Updated: August 1, 2024**

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Holostaff AI website, platform, and AI-powered services (collectively, the "Service") operated by Holostaff AI, Inc. ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

## 1. Accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

## 2. Subscriptions and Billing

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Holostaff AI, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Holostaff AI, Inc. customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Holostaff AI, Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Holostaff AI, Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Holostaff AI, Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

## 3. Free Trial

Holostaff AI, Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Holostaff AI, Inc. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, Holostaff AI, Inc. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

## 4. User Content and Knowledge Data

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("User Content"), including data provided for your AI staff's knowledge base ("Knowledge Data"). You are responsible for the User Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting User Content on or through the Service, you represent and warrant that: (i) the User Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.

You retain any and all of your rights to any User Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for User Content you or any third party posts on or through the Service. However, by posting User Content using the Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such User Content on and through the Service solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service for you. **Your Knowledge Data will only be used by your specific AI staff members and will not be used for general model training or for other customers, as detailed in our Privacy Policy.**
