# Managing Knowledge Sources

Effective management of your Knowledge Sources is crucial to ensuring your AI staff members always have access to accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information. This section covers how to view, update, and delete your existing Knowledge Sources.

## Viewing Your Knowledge Sources

All your created Knowledge Sources are listed on the "Knowledge" page of your Holostaff AI platform.

*   **List View:** Knowledge Sources are displayed as cards or in a list format, showing key details like:
    *   **Name:** The name you assigned to the research task.
    *   **URL:** The website address the knowledge was extracted from.
    *   **Status:** The current state of the Knowledge Source (e.g., "completed," "in_progress," "failed").
    *   **Last Crawled:** The date and time of the last successful data extraction.
    *   **Tags:** Keywords or categories associated with the content.
    *   **Completeness:** An indicator of how much of the intended research or extraction has been completed.
*   **Search and Filter:** Use the search bar to find specific Knowledge Sources by name or URL. You can also apply filters to sort your sources (e.g., by "Last Updated," "Name").

## Viewing Knowledge Source Details

To inspect the detailed information extracted from a specific Knowledge Source:

1.  **Select a Source:** Click on any Knowledge Source card or list item.
2.  **Detail View:** You will be redirected to a dedicated detail page for that source. This page provides:
    *   **General Information:** Basic details about the source, including its URL, current status, and timestamps.
    *   **Website Preview:** A visual snapshot of the website's homepage, if available.
    *   **Extracted Knowledge Tabs:** This is where the actual extracted data is presented, organized into various tabs based on the "Information to Extract" settings chosen during creation. Common tabs include:
        *   **Company Info:** Details about the organization.
        *   **Products:** Information on products offered.
        *   **Services:** Details about services.
        *   **FAQ:** Questions and answers.
        *   **Page Contents:** Summaries or raw content of specific pages.
        *   **Contact Information:** How to get in touch.
        *   **Terms & Policies:** Legal or operational guidelines.

    *   **Item Management:** Within each "Extracted Knowledge" tab, you'll see a table or list of extracted items (e.g., individual products, specific FAQ entries). From here, you can:
        *   **Add Item:** Manually add new knowledge items that may not have been automatically extracted or that you wish to include.
        *   **Edit Item:** Modify the details of an already extracted or manually added item.
        *   **Delete Item:** Remove specific knowledge items from the source.
        *   (*Note: These manual edits will augment the AI's understanding derived from the original crawl.*)

## Maintaining and Updating Knowledge Sources

To ensure your AI staff performs optimally, your Knowledge Sources should be kept up-to-date.

*   **Re-crawl Website:**
    *   If the content on your website has changed, you can initiate a re-crawl to update the Knowledge Source with the latest information.
    *   Locate the "Re-crawl Website" button on the Knowledge Source detail page.
    *   Confirm the re-crawl. This will trigger a new ingestion process, and the Knowledge Source's status will change to "in_progress." Once complete, your AI staff will have access to the refreshed data.

## Deleting Knowledge Sources

If a Knowledge Source is no longer needed:

1.  **Locate the Source:** Find the Knowledge Source you wish to delete in your list.
2.  **Initiate Deletion:** Click the "Delete" (trash can) icon usually found in the actions menu for that source.
3.  **Confirm Deletion:** A confirmation dialog will appear. Read the warning carefully, as deleting a Knowledge Source is a permanent action and immediately removes it from all linked AI staff members. This may impact the performance of those AI staff if they relied solely on that source for information.
4.  **Execute Deletion:** Confirm to permanently remove the Knowledge Source.

Regularly managing your Knowledge Sources keeps your AI staff updated and ensures efficient resource utilization.
