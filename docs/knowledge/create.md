# Website Intelligence Builder

The Website Intelligence Builder is your primary tool for creating new Knowledge Sources by ingesting content from websites. This guided process walks you through specifying the target website and configuring the research parameters to ensure your AI staff learns exactly what it needs.

## Steps to Create a New Knowledge Source

1.  **Access the Knowledge Section:**
    *   From your Holostaff AI Dashboard, navigate to the "Knowledge" section using the main navigation menu.

2.  **Initiate New Source Creation:**
    *   On the "Knowledge Sources" page, click the **"Add New Source"** button. This will display the Website Intelligence Builder interface.

## Builder Steps

The builder guides you through a few simple steps:

### Step 1: Website Details

This step focuses on identifying the website you want your AI to learn from.

*   **Website URL:**
    *   Enter the full URL of the website you wish to analyze (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).
    *   Ensure the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`. This is the starting point for our AI's research.
*   **Task Name:**
    *   Provide a descriptive name for this research task (e.g., "Company Website Product Info," "FAQs from Help Center"). This name will help you identify this Knowledge Source later in your list.
*   **Select Workspace:**
    *   Choose the Workspace where this Knowledge Source will belong. This organizes your data and helps manage access for team members.

### Step 2: Research Settings

This step allows you to configure how Holostaff AI will extract and analyze the content from your specified website. These settings help narrow the focus of the research.

*   **Information to Extract:**
    *   Select one or more topics from the provided list that are most relevant to what your AI needs to learn. This guides our AI to prioritize and extract specific types of information. Common options include:
        *   Company Information (e.g., About Us, Mission)
        *   Products & Pricing
        *   Services Offered
        *   FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)
        *   General Page Content/Summary
        *   Contact Information
        *   Terms & Policies
    *   Selecting specific types helps make the research more efficient and relevant.

*(Additional advanced research settings might be available depending on your subscription plan, such as maximum depth of crawl, time limits for analysis, or specific prompt instructions for the AI.)*

### Step 3: Confirmation and Processing

This is the final step before initiating the research task.

*   **Review Details:** Carefully review all the information you've entered for the website details and research settings.
*   **Start Processing:** Click the "Start Processing" button.
*   The system will then move to a processing view, indicating that the AI is actively crawling, extracting, and analyzing the content from your website. This process can take some time depending on the size and complexity of the website.

## What Happens During Processing?

Once the research task begins:

*   **Real-time Status:** The "Processing" view will show you the current status of the research.
*   **Live Activities:** You may see live logs or updates indicating the progress of the crawling and extraction.
*   **Automatic Screenshot:** Holostaff AI automatically takes a screenshot of the homepage for easy identification.

## What Happens Next?

Upon completion of the processing:

*   You will see a notification indicating whether the research was successful.
*   If successful, the Knowledge Source will be marked as "extraction\_completed" and the extracted knowledge will be ready for use by your AI staff.
*   You will be given the option to **"View Knowledge Source Details"** to see the extracted information or **"Start New Research"** to add another source.
*   If the processing fails, an error message will be provided, and you may be prompted to try again or contact support.

A successfully created Knowledge Source is immediately available for linking to your AI staff members in the "Instructions" tab of the AI staff configuration.
