# Team Management in Workspaces

Holostaff AI's Team Management features allow you to collaborate with colleagues and partners within your Workspaces. You can invite new members, assign them specific roles, and manage their access to your AI staff and knowledge sources.

Effective team management ensures that the right people have the necessary access to contribute to your AI initiatives while maintaining security and organizational clarity.

## Understanding Roles

In Holostaff AI, each team member within a Workspace is assigned a role. These roles define the level of access and capabilities a user has within that specific Workspace. Common roles include:

*   **Owner:** Typically the creator of the Workspace or someone granted full administrative control. Owners have complete access to all features, including billing, member management, and Workspace deletion. There can be multiple owners.
*   **Admin:** Possesses comprehensive administrative privileges within the Workspace, similar to an Owner, but often without the ability to delete the Workspace itself or manage billing fully (specific permissions may vary based on plan details).
*   **Editor:** Can create, edit, and delete AI staff members and manage knowledge sources. They can configure AI behavior, test interactions, and deploy AI staff.
*   **Member:** Can view AI staff members and knowledge sources, participate in testing, and access analytics. They typically cannot make significant changes to AI configurations or deployments.
*   **Viewer:** Has read-only access to AI staff details, configurations (without editing capabilities), and analytics. Ideal for stakeholders who need to monitor progress without making changes.

## Inviting New Members

To invite new members to a specific Workspace:

1.  **Navigate to Settings:** From your Holostaff AI Dashboard, click on "Settings" in the main navigation.
2.  **Access Workspace Tab:** Within the Settings page, click on the "Workspace" tab.
3.  **Initiate Invite:** Locate the "Invite New Member" section.
4.  **Enter Member Details:**
    *   **Email Address:** Enter the email address of the person you wish to invite.
    *   **Role:** Select the appropriate role for this new member from the available options (e.g., Admin, Editor, Member, Viewer).
5.  **Send Invite:** Click the "Send Invite" button.

An invitation email will be sent to the provided address. If the person already has a Holostaff AI account, the Workspace will appear in their list of Workspaces upon accepting the invitation. If they do not have an account, they will be prompted to create one first.

## Managing Existing Team Members

You can view and manage all members currently assigned to a Workspace from the "Workspace" tab within "Settings". The "Current Team Members" list provides an overview of each member's name, email, assigned role, and their current status (e.g., Active, Pending Invite).

*   **Editing Member Roles:**
    1.  Locate the member whose role you wish to change in the "Current Team Members" list.
    2.  Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon or the role dropdown next to their entry.
    3.  Select the new role you wish to assign.
    4.  Confirm the change. The member's permissions will update automatically.
*   **Removing Members:**
    1.  Locate the member you wish to remove from the Workspace.
    2.  Click the "Delete" (trash can) icon next to their entry.
    3.  Confirm the removal in the pop-up dialogue.
    4.  Removing a member will immediately revoke their access to that Workspace and all its contents. For pending invites, this will cancel the invitation.

Regular review of your team's roles and access helps maintain the security and integrity of your AI operations.
