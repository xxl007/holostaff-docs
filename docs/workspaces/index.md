# Workspaces & Collaboration

Holostaff AI is designed to support individual users and teams through the concept of Workspaces. A Workspace is a dedicated environment within the Holostaff AI platform where you can organize your AI staff, knowledge sources, and manage team members who collaborate on specific projects or business units.

Workspaces provide a clean, organized, and secure way to segregate different AI initiatives and control access for collaborators.

## Introduction to Workspaces

Think of a Workspace as a digital office for your AI operations. Each Workspace has its own set of:

*   **AI Staff Members:** Virtual human employees created and deployed for a specific purpose within that Workspace.
*   **Knowledge Sources:** All the data (websites, documents, FAQs, etc.) that the AI staff in that Workspace learn from.
*   **Team Members:** Users invited to collaborate on the AI staff and knowledge sources within that specific Workspace.

Every Holostaff AI account starts with at least one default Workspace. As your needs grow, you can create additional Workspaces to manage different brands, departments, or client projects discreetly.

### Key Benefits of Using Workspaces:

*   **Organization:** Keep your AI staff and knowledge sources logically grouped for easier management.
*   **Collaboration:** Invite team members to work together on AI projects, assigning specific roles and permissions.
*   **Security & Access Control:** Ensure that sensitive information and AI configurations are only accessible to authorized team members within a given Workspace.
*   **Scalability:** Efficiently manage multiple AI initiatives without cross-contamination of data or configurations.

## Creating New Workspaces

While your account comes with a default Workspace, you can create new ones as needed:

1.  **Navigate to Settings:** From your Holostaff AI Dashboard, click on "Settings" in the main navigation.
2.  **Access Workspace Tab:** Within the Settings page, navigate to the "Workspace" tab.
3.  **Initiate New Workspace:** Click on the "Create New Workspace" button.
4.  **Provide Workspace Details:**
    *   **Workspace Name:** Enter a clear and descriptive name for your new Workspace (e.g., "Customer Support EMEA," "Product Launch Q4," "Marketing Team").
    *   **Invite Member by Email (Optional):** You can immediately invite a team member to this new Workspace by providing their email address. If the user does not have an existing Holostaff AI account, they will receive an invitation to sign up.
5.  **Confirm Creation:** Click the "Create" button.

Once created, the new Workspace will appear in your list of available Workspaces, and you will be able to switch to it to start adding AI staff and knowledge sources specific to that environment.

## Managing Your Workspaces

You can manage your existing Workspaces from the "Workspace" tab within "Settings":

*   **Switching Workspaces:** If you have multiple Workspaces, you can easily switch between them to access the relevant AI staff and knowledge sources. Your active Workspace determines which AI staff members and data you currently see and manage within the platform.
*   **Editing Workspace Details:** You may be able to edit the name of a Workspace or other general settings from this section.
*   **Adding/Removing Members:** The "Team Management" section (detailed below) allows you to invite new users or remove existing ones from a specific Workspace.
*   **Deleting Workspaces:** As an Workspace owner, you have the option to delete a Workspace. Please note that deleting a Workspace is a permanent action and will remove all associated AI staff, knowledge sources, and member access. Exercise caution when performing this action.

Your Workspaces are designed to be flexible, adapting to your organizational structure and collaboration needs.
