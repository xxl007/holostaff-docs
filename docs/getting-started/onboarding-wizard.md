# The Onboarding Wizard

After successfully creating and logging into your Holostaff AI account for the first time, you will be guided through a simple Onboarding Wizard. This wizard is designed to collect essential information and preferences to tailor your Holostaff AI experience and prepare your environment for creating intelligent AI staff.

Completing the Onboarding Wizard is a crucial first step, as it sets up your account with the necessary configurations and subscriptions before you dive into building your AI workforce.

## Steps in the Onboarding Wizard

The wizard consists of five straightforward steps, each designed to gather specific details:

1.  **About You:** We'll ask for some basic information about you and your company.
2.  **Your Goals:** You'll select key business objectives that you want your AI staff to help you achieve.
3.  **Billing Details:** Here, you'll choose your subscription plan and securely set up your payment method.
4.  **Welcome Video:** A short introductory video will provide you with a quick overview of Holostaff AI's core functionalities.
5.  **Finish Setup:** A final review of your selections before completing the initial setup.

### Step 1: About You

This step gathers fundamental information about you and your organization. Please provide:

*   Your First Name
*   Your Last Name
*   Your Company Name
*   Your Role within the company

This information helps us understand your context and customize future interactions with Holostaff AI.

### Step 2: Your Goals

In this step, you'll define the primary objectives your AI staff should help your business achieve. You can select up to three goals from a predefined list, which might include:

*   Improve engagement
*   Improve conversion
*   Improve revenue
*   Drive innovation

Your selected goals help our system prioritize and highlight features most relevant to your success within the platform.

### Step 3: Billing Details

This is a critical step for activating your Holostaff AI services. You will:

*   **Select a Subscription Plan:** Choose the plan that best fits your business needs. Information on features and pricing for each plan will be displayed.
*   **Enter Payment Information:** Provide your credit card details securely. All payment processing is handled by Stripe, a leading PCI-compliant payment gateway, ensuring your financial information is protected.
*   **Free Trial:** For many plans, a free trial period will be automatically applied, allowing you to experience the full benefits of Holostaff AI without immediate charge. You will only be billed after the trial period expires, unless you choose to cancel beforehand.

### Step 4: Welcome Video

This step features a brief welcome video designed to introduce you to the Holostaff AI platform. The video will highlight key features and essential steps for getting started.

*   To proceed to the next step, you must watch the entire welcome video.
*   Ensure your speakers are on or use headphones to fully grasp the information provided.

### Step 5: Finish Setup

The final step provides a summary of all the information you've provided and the selections you've made throughout the wizard.

*   Review all the details carefully to ensure accuracy.
*   Once you confirm everything is correct, click the "Complete Setup" button.

## Navigating the Wizard

*   Use the **"Next"** button to proceed to the subsequent step, provided all required fields in the current step are completed correctly.
*   Use the **"Previous"** button (or "Back") to return to the preceding step if you need to review or modify any information.

Once you complete all steps, your Holostaff AI account will be fully activated and ready for you to begin creating and deploying your virtual human staff. You will then be redirected to your main dashboard.
