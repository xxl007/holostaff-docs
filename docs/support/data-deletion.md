# Data Deletion Policy

At Holostaff AI, we respect your privacy and your right to control your personal data. This policy outlines our procedures for data deletion and explains how you can request the removal of your personal information from our systems.

## Your Right to Erasure

You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data held by Holostaff AI, under certain conditions. This right is often referred to as the "right to be forgotten."

## What Data Can Be Deleted?

This policy pertains to personal data associated with your Holostaff AI account, including:

*   Account information (e.g., name, email, contact details).
*   Onboarding data.
*   AI staff configuration details (excluding anonymized usage data).
*   Your Knowledge Data (website links, extracted content, documents uploaded) that you have provided or created within the platform.
*   Billing information (processed by third-party payment providers, but linked to your customer ID).
*   Communication records with our support team.

Please note that this action aims to remove all personal data that can be linked directly to you. Aggregated or anonymized data, which cannot reasonably identify you, may be retained for analytical and service improvement purposes.

## How to Request Data Deletion

To request the deletion of your personal data from Holostaff AI, please follow these steps:

1.  **Submit a Request via Email:** Send an email to our Data Protection Officer.
    *   **Email Address:** `data.officer@holostaff.ai`
    *   **Subject Line:** Please use "DATA DELETION REQUEST" as the subject line.
    *   **Content:** In the body of the email, clearly state your request for data deletion and include your full name and the email address associated with your Holostaff AI account. This helps us verify your identity and locate your data.

2.  **Verification:** We may contact you to verify your identity before processing your request. This is a security measure to protect your data from unauthorized deletion.

3.  **Processing Your Request:** Once your identity is verified, we will proceed with the deletion of your personal data from our active systems.

4.  **Confirmation:** You will receive an email confirmation once your data deletion request has been successfully processed.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Irreversibility:** Data deletion is a permanent and irreversible process. Once your data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
*   **Backup Systems:** Your data may remain on backup systems for a limited period (e.g., for recovery purposes in case of system failure), but it will be rendered inaccessible from live systems and will naturally be purged over time based on our backup retention policies.
*   **Legal Obligations:** We may be required to retain certain information for legal, regulatory, or auditing purposes, even if you request deletion. This retention will comply strictly with applicable laws.
