*   **Authentication Providers (e.g., Google, Facebook):** If you choose to log in through a third-party social network or related service, we may receive certain profile information about you from that provider.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

## 3. Disclosure of Your Information

We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

*   **By Law or to Protect Rights:** If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process (e.g., a court order), to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of Holostaff AI, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers:** We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing (Stripe), data storage (Firebase), analytics, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.

*   **With Your Consent:** We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your explicit consent.
*   **Aggregated or Anonymized Data:** We may share aggregated or anonymized information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, with third parties for various purposes, including business analysis, marketing, or research.

**We do not sell your personal information.**

## 4. Your Knowledge Data

The content you provide for your AI staff's knowledge base (Knowledge Data) is used solely to train and operate your specific AI staff members. We implement strict access controls:

*   Your Knowledge Data is not used to train general AI models or the AI staff of other customers.
*   Access to your Knowledge Data by Holostaff AI personnel is limited and strictly for support, troubleshooting, or service improvement purposes, and only with your explicit consent where feasible and legally required.
*   You retain all rights and ownership of your Knowledge Data. You can manage and delete it through our Services at any time.

## 5. Security of Your Information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. These measures include encryption, firewalls, and access controls. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your personal information.

## 6. Data Retention

We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 9. International Data Transfers

Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to â€” and maintained on â€” computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.
