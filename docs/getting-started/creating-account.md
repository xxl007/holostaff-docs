4.  **Account Creation:** Upon successful authorization, your Holostaff AI account will be created automatically using your social account's associated email address.
5.  **Email Verification (if applicable):** Depending on the social provider and your existing connection, you might still receive an email verification link. Please check your inbox and verify your email if prompted.

## First Login
