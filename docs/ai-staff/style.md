# Style & Appearance Configuration

The "Style" tab is where you define the core identity and persona of your AI Staff Member. This includes its visual appearance and fundamental communication traits. A well-defined style helps your AI integrate seamlessly with your brand and resonate effectively with your users.

Access this tab by navigating to a specific AI Staff Member's detail page and selecting the "Style" tab.

## 1. Basic Information

This section allows you to review and adjust fundamental details defined during creation:

*   **Staff Name:** The name your users will identify your AI with (e.g., "Sarah," "Holostaff Sales").
*   **Role:** The primary function your AI performs (e.g., "Sales Assistant," "Customer Support").
*   **Description:** A brief summary of your AI's purpose or capabilities.

## 2. Avatar Appearance

This section focuses on the visual representation of your AI Staff Member.

*   **Avatar Style:**
    *   Choose a visual style for your AI's avatar. Holostaff AI offers various aesthetic options, such as:
        *   **Casual:** A relaxed and approachable look.
        *   **Business:** A professional and formal appearance.
        *   **Formal:** A refined and highly polished visual.
    *   Selecting a style will filter the available avatars.

*   **Gender Presentation:**
    *   Specify the gender presentation for your AI. Options typically include:
        *   **Male**
        *   **Female**
    *   This selection further refines the pool of available avatars to choose from.

*   **Select Avatar:**
    *   After choosing a style and gender presentation, a gallery of suitable avatars will be displayed.
    *   Browse through the available images and click on a preferred avatar to select it. The selected avatar will be highlighted.
    *   **Important:** An avatar **must** be selected before the AI staff member can be deployed. If no avatar is chosen, a warning will appear.

## 3. Personality Configuration

These settings allow you to fine-tune how your AI communicates and behaves during interactions. You'll adjust two primary sliders:

*   **Communication Style:**
    *   Controls the formality and directness of your AI's language.
    *   **Scale:** Typically ranges from 0 (Casual) to 4 (Formal).
    *   **Impact:** A lower value might make the AI use more informal language, contractions, and a relaxed tone. A higher value will result in more precise, structured, and polite language.
*   **Conversation Pace:**
    *   Determines the level of detail and verbosity in your AI's responses.
    *   **Scale:** Typically ranges from 0 (Concise) to 4 (Detailed).
    *   **Impact:** A lower value indicates shorter, more direct answers. A higher value means the AI will provide more comprehensive explanations, background information, and possibly more elaborate greetings/closings.

By adjusting these sliders, you can create a unique conversational persona that aligns with your brand's desired interaction style. For instance, a sales assistant might lean towards a more "Balanced" communication style and a slightly "Detailed" conversation pace, while a technical support bot might be "Formal" and highly "Detailed."

## Saving Changes

Any changes made within the "Style" tab are automatically saved soon after you make them. There is no explicit "Save" button to click within this tab. However, note that a selected avatar is crucial for deployment, and any changes will affect how your AI is perceived by users.
