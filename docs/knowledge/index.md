# Knowledge Sources

Knowledge Sources are the foundation of your AI staff's intelligence. This section explains how to manage the data that your AI learns from, ensuring it has accurate and relevant information to serve your customers effectively.

Think of Knowledge Sources as the textbooks and learning materials for your AI employees. The quality and breadth of these sources directly impact the intelligence and usefulness of your AI staff members.

## Introduction to Knowledge Sources

A Knowledge Source is a structured collection of information that Holostaff AI can process, understand, and then use to inform the responses of your AI staff members. This information can come from various origins, primarily websites, but can expand to include documents, databases, and more.

By linking an AI staff member to a Knowledge Source, you empower it to answer questions, provide details, and understand concepts based on the data you've provided.

### How Knowledge Sources Work:

1.  **Ingestion:** You provide Holostaff AI with access to your data (e.g., a website URL).
2.  **Extraction & Processing:** Our advanced AI systems crawl, read, and understand the content, extracting key information, entities, and relationships. It learns from product descriptions, FAQs, blogs, policy pages, and more.
3.  **Structuring:** The extracted information is organized into a structured format within your Knowledge Source.
4.  **AI Learning:** Your AI staff members, when linked, can then query this structured knowledge base to formulate intelligent and accurate responses to user inquiries.

### Key Aspects of Knowledge Sources:

*   **Customizable:** You control what information your AI has access to.
*   **Dynamic:** Knowledge Sources can be re-crawled periodically to ensure your AI always has the most up-to-date information.
*   **Secure:** Your Knowledge Source data is kept private and is only used to train your specific AI staff members.

## Types of Knowledge Sources

Currently, the primary type of Knowledge Source supported is:

*   **Website Research:** Provide a website URL, and Holostaff AI will crawl and extract information directly from your public web pages. This is the fastest way to get your AI staff up and running with relevant data.

Holostaff AI is continuously expanding its capabilities to integrate with more data formats and platforms in the future.

## Managing Your Knowledge Sources

The "Knowledge" section of your Holostaff AI platform allows you to:

*   **Create New Knowledge Sources:** Initiate research tasks to ingest data from new websites or other sources.
*   **View Existing Knowledge Sources:** See a list of all your configured Knowledge Sources, along with their status and key details.
*   **Access Detailed Information:** Dive into specific Knowledge Sources to review the extracted content.
*   **Maintain and Update:** Re-crawl websites to ensure accuracy, or manually edit/add specific knowledge items.
*   **Delete Knowledge Sources:** Remove sources that are no longer needed.

In the following pages, we will guide you through the process of creating new Knowledge Sources using the Website Intelligence Builder and managing your existing sources effectively.
